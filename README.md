# Website Scrapper
This project extracts data from a **Google Sheet** containing a list of websites, adds a column labelled **"Category,"** and categorises the websites based on the platform they were built on.

Google OAuth verification is implemented in the project.

Developed a custom [backend](https://codesandbox.io/s/waappanalyzer-server-u1qst2) to evaluate the platform on which the websites were built.
